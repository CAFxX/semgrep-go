semgrep-go
==========

This repo holds patterns for finding odd Go code.

The rules engines currently supported:

* [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)
* [ruleguard](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard)

I'll accept [comby](https://comby.dev) patterns if you can't get them to work with either semgrep or ruleguard.
